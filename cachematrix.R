##Matrix Cache and solving assignment 2 from Coursera R Programing Aug 2014

## cacheing the Matrix. 
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## inverse matrix, hopefully we can save time with out having to compute it. 
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
